# Axios Lab

Pick an API of your choice.

- [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
- [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/)
- [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [Game of Thrones API](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)

1.  Review the data that you can retrieve from the API.  
2.  Design a wireframe of how you could display that data to user on a web page.
3.  Build a web site using html, css, jquery and axios using the API that you chose.

>You may need to add [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) to bypass CORS errors.  Be sure to turn it off once you are done working on the lab.
